# Driving Win-Set

I think there are many dimensions to win-sets. I'll write them below

## What Do I Want

What are my goals? What do I want from a situation.. that is bound in time and context? 

While driving what do I really want? 

1. I do not want impact anyting
2. I do not want to hit others
3. I do not want a ticket
4. I want to minimize damage to my car
5. I want to drive efficiently

## How do I accomplish these things

This is harder.. I want a win-set.. these are in my interest... but actually existing in this state is not easy.

Actions

1. I do not want to be hit
    - I must avoid agressive drivers
    - I must avoid being in the way of vehicles that could fail
    - I must avoid blindspots
    - I must avoid reckless drivers
    - I must follow the norms of the environment around me to avoid confusion
2. I do not want to be hit
    - I think the same as above
    - I must not move without being aware of my surroundings
    - I must use any sensor that will make me aware of danger
3. I do not want a ticket
    - I must know the rules of the environment (ie the legal norms)
    - I must not break the legal norms
4. I want to minimize damage to my car
    - I must drive in away that does not stress the components of my vehicle
5. I want to want to waste fuel
    - I must drive slowly and reduce stress on the drivetrain. This follows minimizing damage


## Context

All of my goals are dependent upon the environment that I am in. I have to balance the actions in the environment around me against my own actions in order to accomplish my goals.  I am I guess trying to predict an outcome based on the factors that I am aware of and how these actions will influence other actions accross time.  

## Time

Actions are contrained by time. As in an action must be made at the correct time in order to avoid a negative outcome.  This is just like a time clock in chess. 

## Bounds

There are not infinitely many outcomes... well maybe there are.. but there are some that are more likely to occur than others.  I need to balance against the most likely than worry about the edge cases

## Encourage an Outcome

I do not think I can layout every action that must occur for an outcome to become a reality.  I think I fall in line with the needs of the environment and encourage a positive outcome by increasing the liklihood of my goal occuring.

## Reference 

I want to better understand statistical dynamics. I want to understand the maths.
